The idea of Graceful Degradation is to get your web app function well on advanced platforms (ideal circumstances) and then getting your webapp to work in lesser platforms. This is related to service workers because service workers allow web apps to function when connectivity is an issue. By implementing a service worker into your web app you are essentially using the idea of Graceful Degradation since you are making your web app more accessible to those that do not have ideal circumstances.
